## StackExchange Bounty ÐApp

The StackExchange ÐApp is composed by a front-end written in CSS/JS situated in
the web-ui folder and by the StackExchangeBounty.sol, which is an Ethereum smart
contract written in Solidity.

The StackExchange Bounty ÐApp enables users to deposit bounties over StackExchange
questions. Oraclize will then query once a day StackExchange APIs and update the 
contract data. When the initial user, the one asking the question in first place, 
selects one of the answer as the most satisfactory one, the contract will pay the 
bounty to the owner of the selected answer, called *winner* in the contract code.
The bounty can be send only if the *winner* has an Ethereum address in the location 
field on his StackExchange subsite profile. If no address is found, Oraclize will 
keep querying for that address once a day until the question's expiration date. 
After that date, if there is no selected answer nor a destination address, the bounty 
or bounties will be returned to their respective owners.

The users on SE will provide their Ethereum address on the location data
field and the deserved bounty will be paied to that address.
